My struggle has been deciding whether to learn Python or Ruby.  Python is
generally seen as more mature and is used for many scientific and academic
purposes.  Ruby is more web-oriented and is used at thoughtbot.  The reason I
always come back to Python is that I think the syntax and structure of the
programs are easier to understand, while I keep coming back to Ruby because of
thoughtbot.  Additionally, Scheme and other lisp languages seem interesting,
mainly (to me, anyways) because of their insanely simple syntax, which does
not get in my way at all.  Python also has the advantage of being better for
data processing.

Learn Python.
